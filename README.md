# StuidoElf.Oqtane.Templates
These are additional templates for the Oqtane framework that use the Code-behind where which the visual and back-end source code are stored in separate files.

**Code Behind**
 
Code Behind refers to (in this instace) the code for a Razor component that is written in a separate class file that can have the extension of .razor.cs depending on the language used. Here the code is compiled into a separate class from which the .razor file derives. You can write the code in a separate .cs code file for each .razor component.
