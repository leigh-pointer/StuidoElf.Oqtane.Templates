# StuidoElf.Oqtane.Templates
These are additional templates for the Oqtane framework that use the Code-behind where which the visual and back-end source code are stored in separate files.

**Code Behind**
 
Code Behind refers to (in this instace) the code for a Razor component that is written in a separate class file that can have the extension of .razor.cs depending on the language used. Here the code is compiled into a separate class from which the .razor file derives. You can write the code in a separate .cs code file for each .razor component. 

**How To Use**

<ol>
<li>

<p> 
The code behind feature offers a number of advantages  :
<ul>
  <li>
    Makes code easy to understand and debug by separating application logic from presentation layer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Itâ€™s also possible to separate the design and development functions by allowing designers to work on the Razor file and coders to do the code-behind development. This is much more difficult to accomplish with inline code.

</ul>
